GAME PLAY 
Use the game play section to create a descriptive paragraph about how the game is played. You want the use tor imagine 
they are actually playing the game. Try not to use generic (i.e., broad, non-descriptive) terms when writing about the game 
play. For example, few readers want to hear statements such as, “enemy_1 will have more hit points than 
enemy_2.” Instead, it’s better to make statements like, “The Lazarus Fighter has more armour than the Apollo Fighter.”

#DESIGN DOCUMENT 
This document describes how GameObjects behave, how they’re controlled and their properties. This is often referred to as 
the “mechanics” of the game. This documentation is primarily concerned with 
the game itself. This part of the document is meant to be modular, meaning you could have 
several different Game Design Documents attached to the Concept Document. 
Design Guidelines 
This is an important statement about any creative restrictions that need to be considered and includes brief statements 
about the general (i.e., overall) goal of the design. 
Game Design Definitions 
This section established the definition of the game play. Definitions should include how a player wins, loses, transitions 
between levels, and the main focus of the gameplay. 
Game Flowchart 
The game flowchart provides a visual of how the different game elements and their properties interact. Game flowcharts 
should represent Objects, Properties, and Actions present in the game. Each of these items should have a number reference 
to where they exist within the game mechanics document.
